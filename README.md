# Introduction
This repository contains codes used to train 2D layered CNNs for performing classification on supernova data (Artifact vs non-artifact).

Tools for use for other datasets:
1. Data visualization
2. Training CNN
3. Viewing model results: learning curves and predictions

# Dataset
The data can be found https://portal.nersc.gov/project/dessn/autoscan/
